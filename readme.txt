1. My term project is called "Clash Royale Lite". It is a replica of Supercell's popular mobile game, Clash Royale
This project incorporates pathfinding and targetting algorithms, a bot opponent, and real time updates to bring the 
exciting Clash Royale experience to users. The objective is this game is to destroy your enemy's towers while defending
your own, all whilst managing your elixir and keeping track of units. There are a variety of different cards, each with
unique attributes that brings forth a fun, engaging experience.

2. In order to run the game, extract the zip folder and make sure that the assets and src folder are present. The assets
folder should be OUTSIDE of the src folder, while the sounds folder should be INSIDE of the src folder. The src and assets
folder should be inside another folder called "Term Project". CMU graphics is the only thing you have to install for the
game to work properly. When runninng, make sure you are in the "main" file before running or else nothing will happen.

3. If you want to end a battle early, you can press "escape" to do so, resetting the battle.
